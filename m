As long as there is only one register to be changed per pin/action,
.reg_mask_xlate should work, as you've already found out.

No, you can't use them as they are kept private, along with
the needed struct gpio_regmap. Which was intentional back then
as it should be easier to change the implementation or add features
without its use being spread all over the gpio drivers.

We could change that though - or just add the needed feature to
gpio-regmap if it looks generic enough.

Sounds promising.
