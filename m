Unfortunately these problems are usually easier to fix on new
platforms, especially during new product development. The hard part is
making sure you haven't regressed any of the legacy platforms when
you're changing the implementation for them as well.

Do you understand the implications of your proposal on the complexity
for those who care about making sure different config combinations
keep building and working, i.e. both the minimal-generic-kernel and
the regular generic version? You've doubled the testing workload for
all of those folks. It's a different mindset from when you mostly need
to care about your one config and platform.
