Go look at a Pixel 5, we got this working just fine with all these
drivers as modules and we definitely care about boot time. You just
need to load your CPU freq driver and the other ones it needs early
on. And with fw_devlink=on (default in upstream), there's hardly any
deferred probing.

Isn't this literally what I was suggesting with my
ARM64_MINIMAL_GENERIC_KERNEL suggestion? Build in all the bare minimum
drivers that are needed before module loading can happen? You'd just
select them all under that config. And any existing platform that
wants to use it would break up their drivers into modules and switch
to it.
