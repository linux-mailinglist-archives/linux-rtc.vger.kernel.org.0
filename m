One of the steps was problem with distros using everything as modules.
They should not receive these drivers as modules.
Reminder: these are essential drivers and all Exynos platforms must have
them as built-in (at least till someone really tests this on multiple
setups).

You are changing not default, but selectability which is part of the
enforced configuration to make platforms working. The distros do not
always choose defaults but rather all as modules. Kernel configuration
is huge and complex, so by mistake they could now even disable
potentially essential driver. There is no need to disable for example
essential clock driver on a supported Exynos platform.

I was not referring to default neither to backwards compatibility.
Please explain why Exynos is special that it does not require essential
drivers to be selected as built-in. For example why aren't same changes
done for Renesas?

Is that now a new global approach that all SoC drivers should be allowed
to be disabled for ARCH_XXX?

The drivers are usually necessary. Actually, you admitted you didn't
test patchset, so how do you even know that they are unnecessary? How do
 you judge?

Good point, but since having them as modules was not tested, I consider
it as theoretical topic.

I don't understand the point (2) here. Anyone can use upstream kernel
for supported and unsupported platforms. How upstream benefits from a
change affecting supported platforms made for unsupported, downstream
platforms.

The selected drivers are essential for supported platforms. We don't
even know what are these unsupported, downstream platforms you want
customize kernel for. They cannot be audited, cannot be compared.

Therefore I don't agree with calling it a "problem" that we select
*necessary* drivers for supported platforms. It's by design - supported
platforms should receive them without ability to remove.

If you want to change it, let me paste from previous discussion:

Affecting upstream platforms just because vendor/downstream does not
want to mainline some code is unacceptable. Please upstream your drivers
and DTS.

Everyone else are working like this. NXP, Renesas, Xilinx, TI, Rockchip,
AllWinner. Samsung or Google is not special to receive an exception for
this.

Downstream uses very specific Linux "distro" or fork - Android - with
changes not present in others. Although tests on other
(unsupported/unupstreamed) devices is good, but it's not sufficient. For
example I guess that half or most of Odroid devices are running standard
Linux distro (Arch, Ubuntu).

You also mentioned downstream devices but without actually ever defining
them. Please be more specific. What SoC, what hardware?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
