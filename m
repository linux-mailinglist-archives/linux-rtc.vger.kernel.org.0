Not necessary the core frameworks, could also be changing the ways the
existing drivers register to allow additional drivers to extend the
functionality rather than completely overwrite them. It's really hard
to tell what the right way would be without knowing the exact things
they find missing in the upstream drivers. As for upstream users, this
is exactly the point - upstream is a bidirectional effort, one takes
from it and should contribute things back.

Generally, the subsystems being mentioned here are so basic (clock,
pinctrl, rtc), that I really can't imagine what kind of rocket science
one might want to hide for competitive reasons... If it's for an
entire SoC, I wonder why Intel and AMD don't have similar concerns and
contribute support for their newest hardware far before the release.
