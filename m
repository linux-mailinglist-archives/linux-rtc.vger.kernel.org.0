Hi Pavel, just to clarify, though I used a script to generate these emails, I
manually reviewed and sent each one; I also manually assigned the subsystems and
sanity checked the bisection results.  (I'm also not on the syzbot team.  I just
care about the security and reliability of the Linux kernel...)  The reason
there are so many of these emails is that there are a lot of kernel subsystems
with open bug reports, many clearly still valid -- even considering that I
decided to skip some subsystems after deciding to just fix the bugs myself,
update the bug statuses myself, send some other email, or just wait.

I suppose there's some argument to be made that it's too noisy to Cc
linux-kernel when I've already assigned a subsystem, though, so I'll try
dropping linux-kernel from Cc for next time and just using the subsystem list
and maintainers, and see if that goes any better or worse.

Note that the syzbot reports themselves are still going to linux-kernel, though.

Thanks!

- Eric
