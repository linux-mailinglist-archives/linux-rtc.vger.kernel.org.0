By "essential", I meant drivers which are needed for supported platform
to boot properly. Also without significant performance penalty due to
probe deferrals.

Therefore if someone selects ARCH_EXYNOS in mainline kernel, it means
he/she wants such devices to be working fine with generic kernel.

This is the difference with term "drivers have to be available".

Geert responded here. If drivers are essential for supported platforms
to boot, having them built-in has technical sense.
For other drivers not and we do not discuss such cases.

The same with all the DTS and hundreds of drivers you keep out of tree.

You twisted (or ignored) my words here. I said before - sacrificing any
mainline platform (e.g. reliable boot for distro) for an out-of-tree
vendor which does no want to upstream drivers is the unfair position.
One of the incentives of upstreaming is to be able to shape kernel and
be considered in kernel upstream decisions. That's the privileged for
upstreamed platforms - they have an impact.

Vendor decides to stay out - fine, vendor's choice. You loose impact.
Any sad words like "oh upstream does not want to change for me" should
receive a message: "please join the upstream :), so we will change
together".

Nope, my last point was not responded to. You said that there is no
point for vendor to upstream bleeding edge HW. Then you said that there
is also little point to upstream older HW.

Basically following this approach you agree that vendor does not have to
do anything because it is inconvenient for him.

However upstream has to adapt to downstream vendor, right?

No, this is *unfair to all the platforms we upstreamed*.

We have then slightly different goals, because you are driven by Android
release images and this is why you are less interested in NXP and
Renesas. Only some vendors should receive such changes? No, in upstream
we are not focusing on any specific distro and there are other uses of
Exynos (and NXP and Renesas) platforms. Therefore the choice/policy and
overall design tries to match all vendors, not only some subset
convenient to Android.

If Android (or some vendor) wants to have exception for a specific
driver/platform, it must do it in upstream way, by contributing, not by
changing to match downstream needs while ignoring other users.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
