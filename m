Probably not, if there's an existing structure to follow, then
continue doing that.

If you have something like "led control registers 1, 2, 3" where 1,2,3
is each LED channel, then use that. Or if the LED supplies (or supply
pins) have some numbering, use that. If there's none of that, then
following standard node names kind of falls apart. '<generic name>-N'
is what I've been defining for some schema.
