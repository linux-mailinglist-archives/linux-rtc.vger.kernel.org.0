AFAIA, there really isn't any GKI specific code.  Everything that can
be upstreamed, is upstreamed.  The delta consists of some vendor
over-rides (implemented using trace events/hooks spread out over the
code-base), lots of function exports (non-upstreamable due to no
upstream user) and some defconfig/fragments.  There really is nothing
else to share/upstream/unhide.

The only thing GKI needs is a little Kconfig flexibility above what is
currently offered.

100% agree.  As I commented in the other patch, this was a good point
that should be addressed

If these could be turned into modules, that would be even better!
