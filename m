The approach for general kernel upstream has been to have the built-in
drivers needed to reach rootfs and runtime load the rest from there.
For downstream embedded kernels, the right answer is to just exclude
the drivers you don't need.

I agree, some of this is probably useful work but
1) It was posted as a burden on the maintainers of the legacy
platforms to test and make sure it's not broken
2) It regresses distro configs, which we do care about
3) Based on the above, it's unclear whether the people pushing for
this patchset cares about the existing platforms, they're looking to
solve a different problem

I didn't go back and look at who and where, but the person who started
justifying this work with making it easier for out-of-tree vendors to
integrate their non-contributed code killed this patchset.

Would the out-of-tree argument on its own kill it? No, but the above
complexities/cost, plus the actual intent behind the patchset did.

I would question the choices made if someone ships a camera with a
generic kernel (without a generic filesystem which at that point also
needs sufficient storage such that the kernel image size becomes a
secondary consideration). Once your storage is that constrained the
balance shifts towards a custom minimal config.
