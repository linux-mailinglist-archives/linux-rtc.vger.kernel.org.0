Hi Krzysztof,

I was trying to chime in, but the discussion got spread out across all
the patches. Since the cover letter seems to have everyone, I thought
I'd reply here. Hope you don't mind. I'll try to respond/chime in on
the various topics that were raised across the patches.

Yes, the next patch series would To/Cc folks correctly. William simply
forgot to use the --to-cover and --cc-cover options when using git
send-email.

I agree with you that it doesn't make sense to have ARCH_EXYNOS
enabled but to have all the clock drivers exynos compiled out. Then
one obviously can't boot an exynos platform using that kernel. I think
William is going to send out a new patch series with a few drivers
modularized. That'll ensure all the common exynos clock code is
modularized and we have a few examples of exynos clock modules.

Speaking of modules, a fully modularized generic ARM64 kernel where
everything is modularized out and we only load the necessary modules
is a great goal. And this is where I can chime in the most since I
wrote fw_devlink and tested this out. Such a kernel is not
hypothetical. IIRC hikey960 can already do this. There's an upstream
amlogic(?) board that can do this (Kevin Hilman has done that). A more
complex/recent/powerful, but downstream example is the Pixel 5 -- it
has a fully modular kernel. 320+ modules! Including interrupt
controllers, timers, pinctrl and clocks.

I can assure you any of the framework code related to pulling off
booting a fully modular ARM64 kernel is already upstreamed
(fw_devlink, irq framework changes, etc) or sent upstream (timer -- by
a SoC vendor, etc) and being worked on. As for fw_devlink, I've
extended it way past what GKI or Android would need. It would have
been super trivial if all I wanted to do was support Android devices.
I've also upstreamed changes that improve module loading time for all
ARM64 modules. All of this and more upstream work came out of GKI and
our push to be upstream first -- so I think it's reasonable to say the
GKI effort helps and cares to get more work upstreamed.

Speaking of GKI, let's not speak of it. It really doesn't matter.
Android is just yet another distribution (albeit a very popular one).
The part that's relevant to upstream/all the other distributions is
the fully modular generic ARM64 kernel and that's what we should focus
on.

In that context, I think William's attempts are reasonable and I think
he'll be glad to fix up any technical issues that people point out. So
hopefully we can focus on that?

Cheers,
Saravana
