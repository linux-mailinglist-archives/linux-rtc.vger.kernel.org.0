This line of reasoning: "I couldn't think of a better option" made us
merge a userspace ABI some time ago that within a few months was
replaced with a better solution. In that case it was the kernel
headers bundling with a build (extending the vmlinux size by a lot),
that seemed to have no concerns about binary growth. Not all that far
after that went in, the BPF folks came up with a solid solution for
CO-RE by introducing BTF, etc.

So, the argument "I can't think of a better solution" is a local
maxima that we shouldn't settle for if there's a likely better global
maxima available with a bit more time/effort. If we say "this problem
is worth solving but this doesn't seem to be the solution we want to
go for" we might actually be better off long-term.
