+Cc Arnd and Olof,

Hi Krzysztof,

To avoid the scrambled conversation from the first patchset, I'm going
to address all your general questions here in the cover letter thread
so that it's easier for everyone to follow and reference in the
future.

First off I did want to chime into the discussion from the previous
patchset, but I felt that Lee and Saravana addressed all your concerns
regarding the intent and feasibility. You also made it clear what the
next steps were that I needed to take.

>Please also explain why Exynos is so special that we deviate from the
>policy for all SoC that critical SoC-related drivers have to be enabled
>(built-in or as module).

I am not actually changing ANY default build configurations here and
I'm not removing any existing configuration. I tried to make it pretty
clear in my original patch series commit messages that none of my
changes modify the default behavior. The .config is the same with and
without my patches. All of these drivers remain enabled as built-in.
So if there is a distro that requires all of these drivers to be
built-in, then they can continue as is without noticing any
difference. IOW, all of these changes are/should be backwards
compatible.

I really appreciate yours and John Stultz's comments regarding
including the "why" in my commit message wording. I will spend more
time on the next series on trying to write a more meaningful commit
message, but before that we can surely discuss the "why" here.

As mentioned by Lee and Saravana, our common goal is to make it easier
for everyone to contribute upstream. In particular, this series of
patches is laying the ground work for distros to have more flexibility
in supporting a wider range of platforms without forcing everyone to
include unnecessary drivers. You said that upstream supports a generic
kernel, but I argue that the upstream "generic" arm64 kernel can't be
considered generic if it builds in SoC specific drivers that can be
modules. This patch series is addressing exactly that -- allow distros
to move SoC specific drivers out of the core kernel and into modules.
Ultimately, our goal is to be able to directly develop with the
upstream kernel on new and old SoCs by not including SoC specific
drivers in our generic kernel distro. This helps the upstream
community in a number of ways:

(1) It makes the ARM64 generic kernel smaller by converting more
drivers into modules
(2) It makes it a lot easier for everyone to develop upstream if they
can directly use the upstream kernel without carrying downstream
changes.

My patch series still keeps the dependencies on ARCH_EXYNOS. I am
totally fine with "depends on ARCH_EXYNOS" and totally fine with
"default ARCH_EXYNOS". The problem we have is that ARCH_EXYNOS
forcefully selects SoC specific drivers to be built-in because it just
adds more and more SoC-specific drivers to a generic kernel.

I know you are asking for me to only push changes that have proven to
work. The theory behind these changes has been proven downstream on
other devices and I'm more than willing to help debug any issues that
arise out of this patch series, but since I don't have the hardware
myself I do need help with device testing these changes. We are not
trying to trick upstream in anyway to accept something that is not
functional or going to hurt the upstream community. I am more than
willing to help upstream and am totally willing to work with upstream
to verify all of these changes before they are accepted (feel free to
send me any dusty, unused hardware lying around if you want the extra
help with device testing).

I hope that helps clarifies things! I will address other patch
specific comments in those threads as well.

Thanks,
Will
