Subject: [PATCHv1 0/6] Support for GE B1x5v2

Hi,

This series adds support for another General Electric patient
monitor series (similar to existing Bx50v3), which is based on
i.MX6DL using Congatec's QMX6 module.

The module uses an I2C RTC to provide the i.MX6 32768 Hz clock,
so it's important to keep it enabled. Not doing so results in
incorrect timings of watchdog and i.MX6 RTC. The bootloader
enables the watchdog, so disabling the clock results in system
reboot. [0]

The second patch is required for B155v2, which uses a 1366x768
G156XTN01 panel. The 1366 width is not supported by the display
pipeline and result in boot hanging without the patch. [1]

Patches 3+4 are updating DT bindings for the new board compatible
values.

Patch 5 adds missing sst25vf032b to spi-nor bindings. Checkpatch
still complains, since the binding lists all chips without vendor
prefix. This probably should be fixed when the files is moved to
YAML, but is non-trivial since those chips are manufactured by
multiple vendors. E.g. sst25vf032b can be sourced from at least
sst and microchip.

Finally patch 6 adds the board files.

Thanks,

[0] There has been a discussion for the problem on the mailinglists
last year. The discussion died off, when I told people their ideas
don't work. I hope using protected-clocks is fine for this usecase.

[1] I've sent this before as a separate patch in September, but
nobody seemed to care. This adds full context for the problem.
