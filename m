Hi,

After some bisecting, I found that commit 05a0302c3548 ("rtc: mc146818:
Prevent reading garbage", this patch, introduced since v5.11-rc1) makes
my VM hang at boot. Before this commit, I got this (and didn't notice)
at every boot:
rtc_cmos rtc_cmos: registered as rtc0
rtc_cmos rtc_cmos: hctosys: unable to read the hardware clock
rtc_cmos rtc_cmos: alarms up to one day, 114 bytes nvram

I notice that this patch creates infinite loops, which my VM falls into
(cf. below).

I didn't succeed to properly fix this without a revert. I tried to set a
maximum number of jumps, but I got pvqspinlock warnings.

Regards,
 MickaÃ«l

My VM loops here.
time->tm_sec is always 255.
