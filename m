Driver should not be changed. We have DT for conveying board specific
parameters.

You don't need to default to anything. The color section will be left
empty if the property is not provided.

I'm referring to this later in this message.

We have fwnode abstraction for that. You can also check:

In case of DT based MFD cell probing you must initialize of_compatible
property of struct mfd_cell element which will then be matched
with struct platform_driver -> driver -> of_match_table in the LED
class driver. Basing on that a relevant platform_device is passed
to the probe function. Its child struct device's of_node property comes
already initialized to the pointer to the corresponding child node
in MFD node.

I didn't suggest that.

Still, there are MFD drivers using of_compatible for matching cell
drivers. I don't follow current trends on MFD subsystem side.
You've got to wait for review feedback from Lee Jones anyway
to find out how to proceed with MFD bindings.

How would you describe the purpose of 'status = "disabled"' DT
assignment then?

Anyway, I entirely disagree here - it is perfectly proper approach
to define platform capabilities by modifying dts file alone.
This way you can easily create multiple versions of platform
configurations. It may be often impractical to enable all available
platform features, at least from business point of view. And recompiling
dts is lightweight operation in comparison to kernel compilation.

Not saying that in some cases there are secret keys required for
encrypting kernel images, that may not always be at hand.

LED naming related data is vital as well.

LED common bindings define that each LED should be described
using child node. And we've enforced sticking to this standard
for last two years strictly.

LED core mechanism for LED name composition also relies on this
DT design - it expects single 'color' and 'function' properties to
be present in the passed fwnode.

LED class registration function registers single LED and it has been
always LED class driver's responsibility to call it for every LED
connected to the LED controller iouts.

This function does not work like that, as explained above.
Please first get acquainted with the way how existing LED class drivers
approach LED registration. Because otherwise we're wasting each
others' time.

For MFD cell you can have just "led".

I wonder what Rob and Lee will say here. I personally would
like to stick to LED common bindings and have this extra node.
We define standards for a reason after all.

If you initialize only of_compatible in struct mfd_cell element then it
will use only that for matching. I bet I was checking that five years
ago while working on leds-max77693 driver.

Thank you for the explanation. So they can be represented by separate
LED class devices. Driver logic will just need to update the state of
the sibling LED if it will be affected.
