There's also more and more movement towards having coprocessors with
standardized interfaces dealing with this functionality. We're
currently at the point where they have coprocessors with
non-standardized interfaces, and it's useful to keep encouraging
convergence in this area to everybody's benefit. I don't find it
particularly useful to make life easier for the custom solutions at
the expense of others like this patchset does, when that's (just
beyond? on?) the horizon.

One of the arguments for needing some of these core drivers in-kernel
is that some platforms boot at very conservative DVFS operating
points, to a degree that you really want to turn up the CPU clocks
fairly early during boot.

If you don't have the drivers built-in, you can't do that and/or you
create possible fragile or awkward inter-module dependencies with
deferred probing, etc. We do care about boot time enough to prefer to
just build them in for this reason.

If vmlinux binary size is a concern, maybe it's time to consider
splitting the drivers into a bare-minimum piece that's not a module
for early setup, and the rest that can be loaded post-boot.
