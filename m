Subject: [PATCH v5 00/16] Support ROHM BD71828 PMIC

Patch series introducing support for ROHM BD71828 PMIC

ROHM BD71828 is a power management IC containing 7 bucks and 7 LDOs. All
regulators can either be controlled individually via I2C. Bucks 1,2,6 and
7 can also be assigned to a "regulator group" controlled by run-levels.
Eg. Run level specific voltages and enable/disable statuses for each of
these bucks can be set via register interface. The buck run-level group
assignment (selection if buck is to be controlled individually or via
run-levels) can be changed at run-time via I2C.

Run level changes can then be initiated wither via I2C writes or GPIO.
and when run-level is changed, state of all bucks which are set to be
controlled via run-levels are changed accrdingly.

This control mechanism selection (I2C or GPIO) is selected by data in
one time programmable PMIC memory area (during production) and can't be
changed later.

In addition to the bucks and LDOs there are:

- The usual clk gate
- 4 IO pins (mostly usable as GPO or tied to specific purpose)
- power button support
- RTC
- two LEDs
- battery charger
- HALL sensor input

This patch series adds support to regulators, clk, RTC, GPIOs and LEDs.

Power-supply driver for charger is "under construction" and not included
in this series.

The series also adds LED DT-node lookup based on node name or given
property name/value pair in LED core. It also adds generic default-state
and default-trigger property handling to LED core. Follow-up patches
simplifying few other LED drivers should follow.

In GPIO framework this series adds devm-support for gpio_array getting
for MFD sub-devices whose GPIO consumer information may be in parent
device's DT node. And while I was at it I also added few missing GPIO devm
functions to the documentaton listing.

Changelog v5:
  Only LED patch (patch 15) changed, rest as in v4.
  LED:
    - Fixed issues reported by Dan Carpenter and kbuild-bot static
      analysis.
Changelog v4 (first non RFC):
  General:
    - Changed subdevice loading and chip version identification to use
      platform ID.
    - License identifiers changed to GPL-2.0-only
  MFD:
    - Styling fixes mostly
  DT-Bindings:
    - a few more checks as suggested by Rob Herring.
    - Order of DT patches changed.
    - me as maintainer
    - standard units to new properties (microvolts, ohms)
    - runlevel values in an array
  LED:
    - BD71828 driver added (back)
      - Added DT support
    - Added LED DT node lookup in led framework when init_data is given
      with DT node match information.
    - Added common property parsing for default-state and
      default-trigger.
  Regulators:
    - dropped sysfs interfaces
    - fixed module unload/reload by binding gpio consumer information to
      regulator device not to MFD.
  GPIO:
    - Added devm_gpiod_get_parent_array
    - added few missing devm functions to documentation

Changelog v3:
  DT-Bindings:
    - yamlify
    - add LED binding doc
  CLK:
    - Move clk register definitions from MFD headers to clk driver
  GPIO:
    - Add generic direction define and use it.
  LED:
    - Drop LED driver from the series (for now).

Changelog v2: Mainly RTC and GPIO fixes suggested by Alexandre and Bartosz
  General:
    -Patch ordering changed to provide dt binding documents right after the
     MFD core.
  DT-Bindings for regulators (Patch 3)
    -Fix typo in PMIC model number
  RTC (patch 11)
    -Reverted renaming in order to reduce patch size.
    -Reworded commit message
  BD71828 regulator (patch 7)
    -Add MODULE_ALIAS
  GPIO (patch 12)
    -Remove file-name from comment
    -prefix IN and OUT defines with chip type
    -improved documentation for the INPUT only pin.
    -removed empty left-over function
    -removed unnecessary #ifdef CONFIG_OF_GPIO
    -removed unnecessary error print
    -Add MODULE_ALIAS

Patch 1:
        dt-bindings for regulators on BD71828 PMIC
Patch 2:
        dt-bindings for LEDs on BD71828 PMIC
Patch 3:
	dt-bindings for BD71828 PMIC
Patch 4:
	Convert rohm PMICs with common sub-devices to use platform_
	device_id to match MFD sub-devices
Patch 5:
        BD71828 MFD core.
Patch 6:
	Power button support using GPIO keys.
Patch 7:
        CLK gate support using existing clk-bd718x7
Patch 8:
        Split existing bd718x7 regulator driver to generic ROHM dt
        parsing portion (used by more than one ROHM drivers) and
        bd718x8 specific parts
Patch 9:
        Basic regulator support (individual control via I2C). This
        should be pretty standard stuff.
Patch 10:
	Add devm_gpiod_get_parent_array
Patch 11:
	Add missing managed GPIO array get functions to documentation
Patch 12:
        Add support for getting regulator voltages when run-levels are
	used. Allow specifying voltages for run-levels via DT and
	in-kernel API. Support changing run-levels via in-kernel API.
Patch 13:
        Support BD71828 RTC block using BD70528 RTC driver
Patch 14:
        Allow control of GP(I)O pins on BD71828 via GPIO subsystem
Patch 15:
	Add LED node lookup and common LED binding parsing support
	to LED class/core
Patch 16:
        Support toggling the LEDs on BD71828.

This patch series is based on v5.4-rc7
