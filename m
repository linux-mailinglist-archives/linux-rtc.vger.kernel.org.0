I don't think those masks will ever change, all the BCD RTCs are using
the same.

Note that ROHM_BD1_MASK_RTC_HOUR_24H, ROHM_BD1_MASK_RTC_HOUR_PM and
ROHM_BD1_MASK_ALM_EN are bits and should use BIT() to make that clear.
Those may change later but I don't see how someone looking at the
BD70528 datasheet would get those wrong.
