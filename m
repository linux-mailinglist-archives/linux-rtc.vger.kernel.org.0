Patch series introducing support for ROHM BD71828 PMIC

ROHM BD71828 is a power management IC containing 7 bucks and 7 LDOs. All
regulators can be controlled individually via I2C. Bucks 1,2,6 and
7 can also be assigned to a "regulator group" controlled by run-levels.
Eg. Run level specific voltages and enable/disable statuses for each of
these bucks can be set via register interface. The buck run-level group
assignment (selection if buck is to be controlled individually or via
run-levels) can be changed at run-time via I2C.

This patch series brings only the basic support for controlling
regulators individually via I2C.

In addition to the bucks and LDOs there are:

- The usual clk gate
- 4 IO pins (mostly usable as GPO or tied to specific purpose)
- power button support
- RTC
- two LEDs
- battery charger
- HALL sensor input

This patch series adds support to regulators, clk, RTC, GPIOs and LEDs.

Power-supply driver for charger is not included in this series.

The series also adds LED DT-node lookup based on node name or given
property name/value pair in LED core. It also adds generic default-state
and default-trigger property handling to LED core. Follow-up patches
simplifying few other LED drivers should follow.

Changelog v8:
  LEDs:
    - Fixed bunch of typos.
    - Corrected the commit message which errorneously contained the
      'leds-compatible' which I dropped in favour of match_property.
    - use max_brightness instead of LED_FULL if it is given when
      handling the default_state, "on".
    - clean fwnode_owned at the end of unsuccessfull registration or
      at the end of deregistration.
    - fix the accidental linuxdoc comment.
    - rename led_find_fwnode to led_get_fwnode as it increases refcount.

Changelog v7:
  - Rebased on top of v5.5-rc2
  - Dropped already applied patches
    - basic regulator support (in regulator tree now)
    - regulator dt-bindings (in regulator tree now)
    - gpio devm function documentation (in GPIO tree now)
  - Dropped new devm-variant of gpio_array getting for MFD sub-devices who
    have consumer information in parent DT node as gpio consumer was
    dropped from the series
  - removed extra line-breaks from MFD driver and Makefile
  - fixed RTC patch subject line (added missing colon)
  - included a patch which adds compatible for ROHM BD71850 PMIC

Changelog v6:
  Rebased on top of v5.5-rc1
  LED core:
    - Do new fw-node look-up only if the new match data is given. That
      way behaviour for existing drivers is not changed
    - Handle generic LED properties by core only if explisitly requested
      in init-data. That way behaviour for existing drivers is not changed
      until they are verified to work.
  BD71828 LEDs:
    - Fix module loading by adding "dummy" of_device_id table.
  DT bindings:
    All:
    - Remove regulator run-level properties as run-level support was
      dropped for now.
    - Change SPDX to dual lisence
    LED:
    - added select: false
    - replace oneOf + const by enum
    Regulator:
    - remove forgotten comments
    - comment indenting
    MFD:
    - remove unnecessary descriptions
  Regulators:
    - Dropped patch 12 with run-level controls
    - Dropped unnecessary ramp_delay_supported() - ram_delay ops were
      already only filled for DVS bucks.
  GPIO:
    - rename internal function.
  RTC:
    - Added missing blank line
  
Changelog v5:
  Only LED patch (patch 15) changed, rest as in v4.
  LED:
    - Fixed issues reported by Dan Carpenter and kbuild-bot static
      analysis.
Changelog v4 (first non RFC):
  General:
    - Changed subdevice loading and chip version identification to use
      platform ID.
    - License identifiers changed to GPL-2.0-only
  MFD:
    - Styling fixes mostly
  DT-Bindings:
    - a few more checks as suggested by Rob Herring.
    - Order of DT patches changed.
    - me as maintainer
    - standard units to new properties (microvolts, ohms)
    - runlevel values in an array
  LED:
    - BD71828 driver added (back)
      - Added DT support
    - Added LED DT node lookup in led framework when init_data is given
      with DT node match information.
    - Added common property parsing for default-state and
      default-trigger.
  Regulators:
    - dropped sysfs interfaces
    - fixed module unload/reload by binding gpio consumer information to
      regulator device not to MFD.
  GPIO:
    - Added devm_gpiod_get_parent_array
    - added few missing devm functions to documentation

Changelog v3:
  DT-Bindings:
    - yamlify
    - add LED binding doc
  CLK:
    - Move clk register definitions from MFD headers to clk driver
  GPIO:
    - Add generic direction define and use it.
  LED:
    - Drop LED driver from the series (for now).

Changelog v2: Mainly RTC and GPIO fixes suggested by Alexandre and Bartosz
  General:
    -Patch ordering changed to provide dt binding documents right after the
     MFD core.
  DT-Bindings for regulators (Patch 3)
    -Fix typo in PMIC model number
  RTC (patch 11)
    -Reverted renaming in order to reduce patch size.
    -Reworded commit message
  BD71828 regulator (patch 7)
    -Add MODULE_ALIAS
  GPIO (patch 12)
    -Remove file-name from comment
    -prefix IN and OUT defines with chip type
    -improved documentation for the INPUT only pin.
    -removed empty left-over function
    -removed unnecessary #ifdef CONFIG_OF_GPIO
    -removed unnecessary error print
    -Add MODULE_ALIAS
