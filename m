If downstream kernel does not use any upstream platforms (e.g.
Exynos5433 or Exynos7) and has its own drivers for everything, then
downstream does not even need ARCH_EXYNOS. Just disable it.

If it works on supported Exynos platforms: awesome!
If it does not work: not that good. I understand that downstream or
vendor do not want to mainline their SoC drivers and SoC support. Either
because HW is too new (do not disclose it) or it is too old (lost
interest). It's their right, they do not have to work with mainline on
this. However changing mainline kernel in such a case to affect it so
you can use your non-upstreamed drivers is wrong.

Affecting upstream platforms just because vendor/downstream does not
want to mainline some code is unacceptable. Please upstream your drivers
and DTS.

Everyone else are working like this. NXP, Renesas, Xilinx, TI, Rockchip,
AllWinner. Samsung or Google is not special to receive an exception for
this.

Awesome! I am in, if it works. :)

Except UFS driver and recent Linaro work on Exynos850, none of these
apply to the vendor discussed here.

Yes, we can focus on that. In technical issues, I do not agree to
affecting negatively supported platforms just because downstream/vendor
does not want to send upstream its drivers.

Please upstream your drivers. By "your" I mean all the drivers which you
want to enable after disabling ARCH_EXYNOS mainline drivers.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
