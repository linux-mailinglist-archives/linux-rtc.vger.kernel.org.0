I'm sorry, it's pretty late here and I'm sleepy and messed it up.

How is this not an upstream problem? Having a minimal kernel with as
many drivers as modules is of interest to upstream. And what's the
complexity in having a config to easily disable a bunch of configs?
The new config gives a clear config against which new
platforms/systems should be developed against.

Sure it would help memory after boot, but it won't help with size on
"disk", kernel load time, etc. And some of the devices have very tight
boot requirements. Think battery operated outdoor cameras for example.
