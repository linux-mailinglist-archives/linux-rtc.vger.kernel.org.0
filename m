IMHO not in upstream, as there is no upstream use yet for not having
the dependencies.

Even if there was, I think it is good to have dependencies like
ARCH_EXYNOS, as they let us partition the (19000, as Arnd said recently)
Kconfig symbols into better manageable groups.  Without these, we cannot
do better than "depends on ARM || ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST".

Greg says that's what defconfig files are for, but the arm64 policy is
to have a single defconfig file only.  But thanks to the ARCH_* symbol,
you can take arm64 defconfig, disable the ARCH_* symbols not applicable
to your platform, and have a good start for a config file tailored to
your platform. Note that works for the arm multi_v*_defconfigs, too.
