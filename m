Then I agree with you.  My position is that if they don't *have* to be
built-in, then why force it?

Not really, but I'll try to clean mine up:

The aim is to have a single kernel (image + modules) that can be
booted on a plethora of platforms.  For the sake of argument say 10.
Let's also say that each of the platforms are equal and will be booted
the same amount of times.

Taking the example above, when I say that the H/W specific drivers
will only be *potentially* utilised, I mean that they will only be
bound and probed 1/10 times i.e. when booted on the associated
platform.  Which means that in the vast majority of boots (9/10) they
will lie dormant, taking up unnecessary space.

Another way to say this would be; the kernel needs to have the
capability to boot all of the supported platforms, but it will only
ever be utilised on one at a time.

Absolutely.

There are cases where drivers simply can't be built as modules.  These
unavoidable situations are legitimate use-cases and the technology/
code-base will have to work around these as required.

The argument here is that if they can be separated and have been shown
to work well in either use-case, then it is my opinion that placing an
artificial barrier up based mostly on politics is not the correct
approach.
