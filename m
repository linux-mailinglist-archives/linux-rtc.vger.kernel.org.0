Thanks for taking the time to respond.  Meanwhile we conducted some
measurements of the time the RTC can keep its value, aka how long the
capacitor can supply it.  Compared internal RTC to external, and came
to the conclusion the longer support time of the external RTC is still
not long enough for a meaningful usecase.  So we dropped that approach
and use the internal RTC of the microcontroller now.

But as said, thanks for responding, if someone else needs to go that
way, the direction from driver pov is clearer now. :-)
