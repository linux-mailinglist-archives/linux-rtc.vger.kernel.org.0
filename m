Yes, I know what you meant by essential.

My comment still stands.  As long as they are provided, it should work.

Agreed.  We will try to find a way to test this.

We're going to have to agree to disagree here.

None of us are currently aware of any technical reasons why these
particular drivers have to be built-in.  Hopefully we can prove this
out with testing.

I do not keep any drivers out of tree. :)

No one is proposing to sacrifice anything.

This change is believed to be benign.

The driver in question is already upstream.

It is my hope that the vendor will realign with Mainline and upstream
the differences (providing the current competitive edge).  Although I
have no real influence in this regard, as I have no contact with
them.

The point here is that this change should not be a determent to
anyone.

No users are being ignored.  No damaging changes are being proposed.

This has little to do with Android and everything to do with the
possibly of a more generic kernel.  Moving drivers out of platform
code and into /drivers along with enabling components as modules has
been an on-going effort for many years now.

I'm struggling to see how this is different.
