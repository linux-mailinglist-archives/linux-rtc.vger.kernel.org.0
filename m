I'm Mrs. Sergeant Jess Payne.

In the military branch of the US Army. USA, A Sergeant, 32, I am
single from Cleveland, Tennessee, United States, currently stationed
in Syria, at war with terrorism. My unit is the 782nd Brigade Support
Battalion, 4th Nursing Team.

I am a loving, honest and affectionate person with a good sense of
humor, I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know their way of
life, I enjoy seeing the waves of the sea and the beauty of the
mountains and all that nature has to offer. It would be a pleasure to
know more about you and I think we can establish a good business
friendship.

I have been so much unhappy because life has been unfair to me for
some years now; i lost my parents, when i was 21 years. My father name
is Joel Payne and my mother Mary Payne. Nobody to help me, but am
happy i finally found myself in the US military.

I got married and had a child, but he died and shortly after my
husband started cheating on me, so I had to give up the marriage.

I am also blessed there in my country, the United States, and here in
Syria, with everything I need in life, but no one to advise me. In
which I need an honest person to trust and who will also advise me on
how to invest my money. Because I was the only girl my parents gave
birth to before they died.

I don't know you in person, but I think there is a good human being
who can be trusted and who can build authentic trust and good business
friendship, I also have something to share with you if you really have
a name of honesty and trust. On you, because I will need your help. I
have in my possession the sum of ($ 5.5 million) that I made here in
Syria. I will tell you how I did it in my next email, do not panic,
they are risk free and I also deposited this money in a bank with the
help of a humanitarian doctor linked to the Red. I want you to present
yourself as my beneficiary to receive the Fund and keep it safe when
I'm done here and get my military pass to meet you there in your
country; don=E2=80=99t be afraid the bank will store the fund in an ATM VIS=
A
CARD which is secured and faster for us.

Note; I don't know how long we are going to stay here and my destiny
since I survived two bomb attacks here, which led me to look for a
trustworthy person to help me receive and invest the Fund, because I
will be coming to your country of origin to invest and start a new
life, no longer as a soldier.

Please respond to me if you are willing to handle this carefully. I
will tell you the next process and send you more information about the
bank where the Fund is deposited. And how the bank will help us move
the money to your country through ATM VISA CARD. Please contact me if
you are interested.
