Patch series introducing support for ROHM BD71815 PMIC

Please note that this series depend on previously sent patches.

Already merged regulator patches (in regulator tree - not yet in Linus'
tree):
[PATCH] regulator: ROHM bd7xxxx: Do not depend on parent driver data
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210105130221.GA3438042@localhost.localdomain/
[PATCH] regulator: bd718x7: Stop using parent data
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210107122355.GA35080@localhost.localdomain/

Already merged GPIO patch (in GPIO tree - not yet in Linus' tree):
[PATCH] gpio: bd7xxxx: Do not depend on parent driver data
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210105125335.GA3430233@localhost.localdomain/

Also, the patches 1 and 2 have been sent separately to clk and rtc
subsystems - but they have not yet been reviewed / applied. They are
present also in this series because the series depends on those changes.
I will drop those patches from this series if they get merged to clk/RTC
trees from previous submissions.

Please note that due to the dependencies all of the patches are probably
not applying cleanly to all subsystem trees. (regulator/RTC patches to
other subsystems). I understand it perfectly well if this series can't be
merged before all dependencies are merged to all relevant subsystem trees
but I would be grateful if I got the first set of review comments even
before that.


ROHM BD71815 is a power management IC used in some battery powered
systems. It contains regulators, GPO(s), charger + coulomb counter, RTC
and a clock gate.

All regulators can be controlled via I2C. LDO4 can additionally be set to
be enabled/disabled by a GPIO. LDO3 voltage could be selected from two
voltages written into separate VSEL reisters using GPIO but this mode is
not supported by driver. On top of that the PMIC has the typical HW
state machine which is present also on many other ROHM PMICs.

IC contains two GPOs - but one of the GPOs is marked as GND in
data-sheet. Thus the driver by default only exposes one GPO. The second
GPO can be enabled by special DT property.

RTC is almost similar to what is on BD71828. For currently used features
only the register address offset to RTC block differs.

The charger driver is not included in this series. ROHM has a charger
driver with some fuel-gauging logig written in but this is not included
here. I am working on separating the logic from HW specific driver and
supporting both BD71815 and BD71828 chargers in separate patch series.
