Thanks. I can say that reverting this has no effect on lockdep's splat,
so your change is in the clear.

However, there's also regmap-irq stuff to consider in the backtrace,
and looking at this today, I can't see how regmap-irq can be nested.

drivers/rtc/rtc-max77686.c makes use of regmap-irq since commit
f3937549a975 ("rtc: max77686: move initialisation of rtc regmap, irq
chip locally") in 2016.

drivers/mfd/max77620.c also makes use of regmap-irq since commit
327156c59360 ("mfd: max77620: Add core driver for MAX77620/MAX20024")
also in 2016.

Looking at the regmap-irq code, not much has changed in
regmap_irq_lock() and regmap_irq_sync_unlock(). The same seems true of
the ordering in irq_set_irq_wake(). So, I don't think this is a
regression as such, but a latent bug that either no one has bothered
to report, or no one bothers to test with lockdep enabled anymore.

I think the sequence here is:

irq_set_irq_wake() for IRQ 95 (rtc-alarm1) is called.
 + regmap_irq_lock() is called, which takes d->lock for IRQ 95
 + ... irq_set_irq_wake() does stuff
 ` regmap_irq_sync_unlock() is then called
   + this synchronises the wake state with the parent by calling
   | disable_irq_wake() or enable_irq_wake() as appropriate.
   | This calls irq_set_irq_wake(), causing recursion but on a
   | different IRQ, which also uses regmap-irq.
   | + regmap_irq_lock() is called, which takes d->lock for IRQ 94
   | |    * SPLAT *
   | + ...
   ` d->lock is released

This highlights the problem with "d->lock" - using "d" for a variable
name, while short, doesn't actually tell us what lock it is - is it
the irqdesc lock in kernel/irq ? Is it the regmap_irq_chip_data mutex
called "lock" in regmap_irq? It looks to me like it's the mutex.

So, I'd like to start a campaign against single-letter variables,
especially when it comes to code that takes locks! We should have
something in the kernel coding style which prevents single-letter
variable names when locks are taken!

I can't see that anything has changed in the code with regards to the
locking, so I think this is a bug that's been present ever since these
drivers were introduced, and regmap-irq is deficient in that it causes
the same lockdep lock class to be taken recursively when the IRQ wake
state changes.

From what I can see, irq wake support for regmap-irq was added in
commit a43fd50dc99a5 ("regmap: Implement support for wake IRQs") and
this is the only operation that is propagated to the parent
interupt(s). Thus, the above splat is unlikely to occur unless one
makes use of wake support on a regmap-irq based interrupt whose
parent is also regmap-irq based.

So, adding Mark Brown.
