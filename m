I really meant "essential/necessary/required to be built-in".

It was a comment to your "*potentially* utilised on *some* platforms".
It is clear they are not used on the other ("not *some*") platforms, but your
sentence was unclear whether they are always or only sometimes used on
"*some*" platforms.
"always" => "not potentially"
"sometimes" => "potentially".

I hope this makes it more clear.

It all depends on why the driver is "required to be built-in".
Depending on the reason behind that requirement, the driver can be
changed from built-in to modular without ill effects on functionality.
