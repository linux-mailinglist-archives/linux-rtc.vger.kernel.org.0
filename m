As Geert pointed out in another reply, that prevents the use of
earlyconsole on an exynos SoC + fully modular generic kernel. Are we
okay with removing the ARCH_EXYNOS dependency on the early console
driver now?

Yes, that's the idea :) What's the point of sending a module upstream
if it doesn't work with upstream? And this is where William would need
help with testing.

Since the goal is to have some of the existing clock drivers work as
modules, we wouldn't be running into this situation above.

I obviously can't force a vendor to upstream their stuff and I can't
speak for them. However the Android kernel team's goal is to have the
core Android kernel be the upstream kernel (we are making progress
every year). This will also have the nice effect that vendor
downstream drivers written for Android would automatically be
compatible with upstream and way more likely to get upstreamed.

I'm not sure I fully understood this part. But if your point is that
we shouldn't have a negative impact on hardware supported in upstream
just so a downstream driver can work, I completely agree with you.

At the same time, it also doesn't make sense to have a negative impact
on upstream (rejecting patches that are working towards a fully
modular generic ARM64 kernel) just because it might also help
downstream drivers. That is like cutting your nose to spite your face.

Also, by taking this position, you are just making it even harder to
upstream the downstream drivers while also hurting upstream. Which is
clearly not what we want. Almost all vendors have engineers working
for them that'd like to see more of their code upstream. Treating them
as one monolithic "vendor" entity doesn't help. You are just making it
harder for the pro-upstream engineers to make a case for upstreaming
their drivers.
