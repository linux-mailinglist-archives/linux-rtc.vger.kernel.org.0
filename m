Subject: [PATCH v5 00/19] Support ROHM BD71815 PMIC

Patch series introducing support for ROHM BD71815 PMIC

ROHM BD71815 is a power management IC used in some battery powered
systems. It contains regulators, GPO(s), charger + coulomb counter, RTC
and a clock gate.

All regulators can be controlled via I2C. LDO4 can additionally be set to
be enabled/disabled by a GPIO. LDO3 voltage could be selected from two
voltages written into separate VSEL reisters using GPIO but this mode is
not supported by driver. On top of that the PMIC has the typical HW
state machine which is present also on many other ROHM PMICs.

IC contains two GPOs - but one of the GPOs is marked as GND in
data-sheet. Thus the driver by default only exposes one GPO. The second
GPO can be enabled by special DT property.

RTC is almost similar to what is on BD71828. For currently used features
only the register address offset to RTC block differs.

The charger driver is not included in this series. ROHM has a charger
driver with some fuel-gauging logig written in but this is not included
here. I am working on separating the logic from HW specific driver and
supporting both BD71815 and BD71828 chargers in separate patch series.

Changelog v5:
  Regulator:
  - Added regmap helper for regulator ramp-delay and taken it in use
    (patches 13, 14, 16 - they can be just dropped if ramp-delay helper is not
    a good idea. Patch 15 implements old-fashioned ramp-delay)
  GPIO:
  - styling changes to GPIO (Mostly suggested by Andy)
  - implemented init_valid_mask (but can't count on it yet)
Changelog v4:
  - Sorted ROHM chip ID enum
  - Statcized DVS structures in regulator driver
  - Minor styling for regulator driver
  - rebased on v5.12-rc4
Changelog v3:
  - GPIO clean-up as suggested by Bartosz
  - MFD clean-up as suggested by Lee
  - clk-mode dt-binding handling in MFD driver corrected to reflect new
    property values.
  - Dropped already applied patches
  - Rebased on v5.12-rc2
Changelog v2:
  - Rebased on top of v5.11-rc3
  - Added another "preliminary patch" which fixes HW-dvs voltage
    handling (patch 1)
  - split regulator patch to two.
  - changed dt-binding patch ordering.
  regulators:
    - staticized probe
    - removed some unnecessary defines
    - updated comments
    - split rohm-regulator patch adding SNVS and supporting simple
      linear mapping into two - one adding support for mapping, other
      adding SNVS.
  GPIO:
    - removed unnecessary headers
    - clarified dev/parent->dev usage
    - removed forgotten #define DEBUG
  dt-bindings:
    - changed patch order to meet ref-dependencies
    - added missing regulator nodes
    - changed string property for clk mode to tristated
  MFD:
    - header cleanups.
  CLK:
    - fixed commit message
