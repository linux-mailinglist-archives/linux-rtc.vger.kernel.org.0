Exactly.
And patches to change this that haven't been tested at all should be
very clearly marked that way.

There seem to be two different meanings for a "generic" kernel:
  1. To me, a generic kernel is a kernel that can boot on a variety of
     hardware platforms. and will operate correctly with all expected
     functionality.  That is, it should include[1] drivers for all that
     hardware.
     Examples of this are arm/multi_v7_defconfig and arm64/defconfig.
  2. To GKI, a generic kernel is a minimal kernel that doesn't include
     any[2] hardware-specific drivers, and has loadable modules for
     all[2] hardware-specific drivers. Before loading these modules, it
     can run an application on the CPU, but it cannot do any I/O to real
     hardware.

[1] Developers usually want the drivers builtin, distros want them
     modular.
[2] On arm/arm64, this must rely on the GIC and architectured timer
    being built-in (AFAIK these cannot be modules yet), and thus
    precludes booting on Cortex A9 and older that lack GIC and/or
    architectured timer as their primary interrupt controller and timer.
    I'm wondering how this works on other architectures with
    less-standardized interrupt controllers and timers?

Indeed. X86 has less variability in the hardware than other
architectures, and has all the critical drivers built-in or in firmware.
Where there have been big differences (remember Voyager?), x86 never
had the option to have a generic (in the meaning of 1 above) kernel
(but James did try, cfr. https://lwn.net/Articles/328469/).
