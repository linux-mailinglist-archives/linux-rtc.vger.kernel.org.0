Agreed. I absolutely love the work of the GKI developers to turn more
drivers into loadable modules, but the "correctness-first" principle is
not up for negotiation. If you are uncomfortable with the code or the
amount of testing because you think it breaks something, you should
reject the patches. Moving core platform functionality is fundamentally
hard and it can go wrong in all possible ways where it used to work
by accident because the init order was fixed.

I'm not overly worried about the defaults. If the drivers work as loadable
modules, I'm happy with them being loadable modules in distros.
If they don't work this way, then the patches are broken and should
not get merged.

I don't even mind having essential drivers that can be turned off,
since we already have a ton of those (e.g. serial ports on most platforms).
It's up to distros to know which drivers to enable, though having
either reasonable defaults or fail-safe Kconfig dependencies (e.g.
making it impossible to turn off but allowing modules) is clearly
best.

I wouldn't enforce it either way across platforms. I would prefer drivers
to be loadable modules where possible (and tested), rather than
selected by the platform Kconfig. If you want to ensure the exynos
drivers are impossible to turn into a nonworking state, that's up to you.

I actually disagree strongly with labelling the kernel as "non-generic"
just because it requires platform specific support to be built-in rather than
a loadable module. This has never been possible on any platform
I'm aware of, and likely never will, except for minor variations of
an existing platform.

Look at x86 as an example: there are less than a dozen SoC platforms
supported and they are incredibly similar hardware-wise, but the kernel
is anything but "generic" in the sense that was mentioned above.
Most of the platform specific drivers in arch/x86/platform and the
corresponding bits in drivers/{irqchip,clocksource,iommu} are always
built-in, and a lot more is hardwired in architecture code as PCI
quirks or conditional on cpuid or dmi firmware checks.

Agreed. I understand that it would be convenient for SoC vendors to
never have to upstream their platform code again, and that Android
would benefit from this in the short run.

From my upstream perspective, this is absolutely a non-goal. If it becomes
easier as a side-effect of making the kernel more modular, that's fine.
The actual goal should be to get more people to contribute upstream so
devices run code that has been reviewed and integrated into new kernels.

I'm generally fine with "obviously correct" ones as well, but it's up to
you to categorize them ;-)
