I guess 'why' is easy enough to address.

Things are a bit scattered around I'll admit. I feel like we need a
'start here', but the challenge is people have different starting
points.

TBC, I have not and am not. It's just an idea. There's been nothing
done beyond experimenting if rST could be embedded into yaml.

That's a case of needing to adjust the meta-schema (the schema that
checks the schemas). It's a bit overly restrictive just to try to
contain what's allowed. I've fixed it now. Update dtschema and it
should work now.

BTW, what you will also need is to reference the common schema:

"^BUCK[1-7]$":
  type: object
  allOf:
    - $ref: regulator.yaml#
  properties:
   rohm,dvs-runlvl-ctrl:
     type: boolean
     description: ...
   ...
