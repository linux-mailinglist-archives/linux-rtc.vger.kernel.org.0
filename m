Why?

If the drivers are really essential/necessary/required, this precludes
running the generic kernel image on the platform that requires them,
making the kernel not sufficiently generic.

True, if "potentially".  If not potentially, they must be included.

The key here is if the driver is required or not to use the platform,
and why it is required.  If the requirement comes from some deficiency
in the kernel code or config system, it should be fixed, if possible.
And the fix should be tested.
If it cannot be fixed, the driver should be included, else it would
preclude running the generic kernel on the affected platform.

The replacement drivers are already a downstream kernel fork, which you
would like to avoid?
