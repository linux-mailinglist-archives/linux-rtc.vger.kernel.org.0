Because without them the image wouldn't functional on any level.

But you're right, there is still no requirement for it to be built-in.

If they are not at all present, then yes.  However that is not what is
being suggested.  The essential functionality will be provided.  Just
not built-in.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.  Would you mind elaborating?

Sorry, I'm not following.

Avoid, yes, absolutely.

However, in the real world of competitive tech, other than in extreme
cases such as; fully open source, community driven, cute embedded
hobby platforms, there will always be changes required on-top of
upstream projects.  Even as upstream kernel developers we need to
understand and respect that.
