Are you saying that modularizing drivers is opening up a loophole? How
is this different from Krysztof pushing changes to modularize the
Exynos ChipId driver just last week [1].  I understand the push back
on "these aren't tested yet" and I agree that we should not merge them
until they are (I've re-iterated that multiple times and have
requested for testing help multiple times since I can't get my hands
on any Exynos arm64 hardware), but are you saying that if I gather the
test data to prove that these drivers can actually be made into
modules that you will still deny them out of the interest of the
community?
