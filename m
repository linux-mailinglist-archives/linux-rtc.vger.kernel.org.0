While the UART early console can work (assuming the related hardware
setup has been done by the boot loader), the actual serial driver
usually cannot, as it relies on clocks, PM Domains, pin control, which
won't be available until the corresponding modular drivers are loaded.
Actually earlycon is a debug feature, so I'm wondering if you actually
want that in your GKI kernel?

Cortex-A7/A15 and later have GIC and architectured timer, so it should
work for contemporary systems.
Cortex-A9 systems may have GIC, and TWD and/or Global Timer (but I've
seen SoCs where the interrupt for the latter was not wired :-(.

What are the plans for other architectures?
I've seen similar patches being applied for e.g. MIPS.
