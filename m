Hmm. It seems dropping that property for v2 under the assumption that
efivars would be available at module init time (since the driver can
only be built-in) was a mistake.

I see now that the current qcom efivars driver does not probe until
module init time itself, but even if we change that the scm driver
depends on an interconnect driver which can be built as a module...

I guess we need that property on these platforms as I had initially
concluded after all. As with the rest of this driver, hopefully all of
this goes away for future Qualcomm platforms once they fix their UEFI
implementation so that the time service can be used directly.
