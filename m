I don't think there's a Linux kernel API that you can use to achieve that, so
that's a rather theoretical concern at the moment.

Also there are multiple clocks, that can drive the RTC, and you usually don't
drive it from 24MHz DCXO oscillator. The reason is that you'd have to deal with
the fact that the clock for RTC then becomes 24000000/750 (750 is fixed
divider), which is 32000.

So if you want to get 32768Hz for RTC by tuning the DCXO, it would have to have
24 576 000 Hz. And even if you could achieve that (doubtful), it would throw off
timings in the rest of the system (say UART, USB, CPU, display ctl) in a major way.

I guess you can try tuning 24MHz oscillator so that it's closer to the
real-world 24MHz via NTP reference for other reasons. But it would be
complicated, and require precise interaction with other components, like using
HW timers sourced from 24MHz HOSC clock, because you can't use CPU's timers,
because of inaccuracies introduced during DVFS, for example.
